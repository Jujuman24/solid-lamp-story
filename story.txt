Hello man,
one time I was playing minecraft and I had a full diamond set of armour.
I felt so accomplished. All my life's goals were met. That was before SauceDripper69 joined my realm without my permission....

I then remembered that Mario Kart is a far superior game! I plugged in my Wii and selected my favorite character: Princess Peach.

	Then I got sucked into the matrix and became Neyo. Clearly my skills are vastly superior. Give me my degree now.
Seven years later, I receive my PHD in CS in LMAO University, and easily get a job in Google, as someone who cleans the restrooms. Goal accomplished. 

	After all this happened, I woke up from this awful nightmare, ready to move on with my life and ensure that this didn't happen. I went back to playing minecraft competitively and began to take interest in basketball and medicine. I went to UCLA and got my degree in Biology and Chemistry as I became the MVP of the college basketball team and got into med school. I looked back on my life 30 years later as an accomplished doctor, and a person with a sizable impact on the lives of those around me, or so I hoped.
	
	In reality I ended up just playing minecraft and becoming the world's best hunger games player. La Fin.
