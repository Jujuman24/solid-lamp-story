Hello man,
one time I was playing minecraft and I had a full diamond set of armour.
I felt so accomplished. All my life's goals were met. That was before SauceDripper69 joined my realm without my permission....

I then remembered that Mario Kart is a far superior game! I plugged in my Wii and selected my favorite character: Princess Peach.

	Then I got sucked into the matrix and became Neyo. Clearly my skills are vastly superior. Give me my degree now.
Seven years later, I receive my PHD in CS in LMAO University, and easily get a job in Google, as someone who cleans the restrooms. Goal accomplished.
